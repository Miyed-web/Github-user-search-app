# AM Niloy - GitHub User Search App 

![Design preview for the GitHub User Search App project](./screenshot.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end project.

My project is to build out this GitHub user search app using the [Github Users API](https://api.github.com/users/user) and get it as close to good looking design as possible.



Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- they able to search their GitHub profile details by just clicking the search button 
- all the GitHub user details will be included on there
